# Infoteh
Simple test project.
# Conditions
1. Create an application using UIKit.
2. Architecture - MVP.
3. UI using standard elements.
4. The application must receive a list of cities from a json file (city_list). List of cities display in the table.
5. We display the image in the left part of the cell (https://infotech.gov.ua/storage/img/Temp3.png) for even cells and the second image (https://infotech.gov.ua/storage/img/Temp1.png) for non-even cells, but with right name of the city. We receive the image by request and cache the ego.
6. On the screen of the list of cities, we implement a search by city with filtering of the same list.
7. Clicking on a city will take you to a detailed screen displaying the weather in this city (request to the OpenWeather service). In the upper part, we display a map with a city coordinate point (the map occupies a third of the screen height). In the lower part, we display the following data:
- Description;
- Current air temperature;
- Min., max. air temperature;
- Air humidity;
- Wind speed.
8. Create a parallax effect on detailed screen.
